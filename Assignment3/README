Client-Server game. The client connects to the server via TCP socket and sends the name and number of riddles they think they can answer. The server
has a JSON array of riddles that it sends to the client. If the client answers the number of riddles in the time provided, they win. If not they lose.

Run server with:
gradle runServer −Pport = port.

Run Client with:
gradle runClient −Pport=port −Phost=hostIP.
